If you provide the source code for the Solidity contract and the tests you'd like to write for it, I can assist you in generating dynamic tests for the contract using Manticore. Could you share the contract code and the specific tests you'd like to write for it? 

Here's an example of how you can use Manticore to generate dynamic ABI encoder tests for a Solidity contract:
```python
import pytest
from web3 import Web3
from web3.contract import Contract
from mantis.core.utils import generate_dynamic_abi_tests

@pytest.fixture
def contract_address():
    return "0x..."  # Provide the actual contract address here

@pytest.fixture
def todo_list_contract(web3: Web3, contract_address):
    contract = web3.contract(abi=TodoList.abi, address=contract_address)
    return contract

@pytest.fixture
def dynamic_tests(todo_list_contract):
    yield from generate_dynamic_abi_tests(todo_list_contract)

def test_dynamic_abi(dynamic_tests):
    # Now you can run the dynamic tests using pytest
    for test in dynamic_tests:
        test()
```

You'll need to replace the placeholders with the actual values. Make sure you have the `TodoList` contract ABI and address available, and you can use the `generate_dynamic_abi_tests` function to dynamically create and yield tests based on the contract methods and their signatures. 

Please note that you would need to install the required dependencies, such as `web3`, `pytest`, and `mantis` (or `manticore`). 

Would you be able to provide the necessary information so that I can assist you in generating specific dynamic tests for the TodoList contract and its methods?
