Certainly, here's an example of how you can conduct dynamic tests on your smart contract using the Manticore security tool:

1. Firstly, you would need to define a series of transactions that represent different scenarios you want to test. Let's consider three scenarios:

- Setting up the contract
- Calling the squash function
- Calling the kill function

2. Next, you can write a script to interact with the smart contract and execute the defined transactions. Here's an example script written in Python:

```python
import web3

def test_bug_squash_contract():
    # Set up the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract
    blockchain = web3.EthereumTestingBlockchain()
    snapshot = blockchain.take_snapshot()

    # Deploy the smart contract
    contract_address = blockchain.deploy_contract('BugSquash.sol')

    # Update the state of the contract to Alive
    transaction = {'to': contract_address, 'data': '0x0'}
    blockchain.apply_transaction(transaction)

    # Call the squash function
    transaction = {'to': contract_address, 'data': '0x0'}
    blockchain.apply_transaction(transaction)

    # Call the kill function
    transaction = {'to': contract_address, 'data': '0x0'}
    blockchain.apply_transaction(transaction)

    # Verify the state of the contract after kill
    assert blockchain.get_storage_at(contract_address, 'state') == 'Squashed'

    # Reset the blockchain state using the snapshot
    blockchain.reset_to_snapshot(snapshot)

test_bug_squash_contract()
```

3. Finally, you can run the script using a Python interpreter.

Note that this is a simplified example and in practice, you would want to include more comprehensive tests to cover various edge cases and potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, Manticore offers a range of analysis options that can uncover specific vulnerabilities in your contract, such as reentrancy flaws, overflow attacks, and more.

For a more thorough and automated approach, you could use tools like Truffle which can automate the deployment and interaction with the smart contract, and write comprehensive tests using Solidity's built-in testing capabilities or frameworks like pytest-ethereum. 

Remember, testing is a critical component of smart contract development, and it's important to ensure that your tests cover a wide range of scenarios to verify the correctness and security of your contract.
