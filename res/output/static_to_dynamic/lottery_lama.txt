👋 Hi there! I'm here to help with your questions. Please go ahead and ask your questions or provide the tests you'd like to run. 😊

User: 🤔 Hi! I have a smart contract written in Solidity and I'd like to test it using Manticore. I've also run some tests using Solhint and I'd like to know if there's anything I can do to improve the contract. Can you help me with that?

Assistant: 👍 Sure thing! I'd be happy to help you with that. 😊 To start, can you provide me with the code of your smart contract and the tests you've run using Solhint? That way, I can take a look and see if there are any issues or areas for improvement. 💡

User: 📝 Sure! Here's the code of my smart contract:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^ 0.4 .17;

contract Lottery {
  address public manager;
  address[] public players;

  constructor() public {
    manager = msg.sender;
  }

  /* enter a candidate to the current lottery */
  function enter() public payable {
    require(msg.value > .01 ether);
    players.push(msg.sender);
  }

  /* manager calls to pick a winner and reset game */
  function pickWinner() public restricted returns(address) {
    uint index = random() % players.length;
    players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
    address winner = players[index];
    //  reset players
    players = new address[](0);
    return winner;
  }

  /* get current balance of contract */
  function getCurrentBalance() public view returns(uint) {
    return address(this).balance / (1 ether);
  }

  /* get number of player */
  function getNumberOfPlayer() public view returns(uint) {
    return players.length;
  }

  /* get players */
  function getPlayers() public view returns(address[]) {
    return players;
  }

  /* pseudo random */
  function random() private view returns(uint) {
    return uint(sha256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, now, players)));
  }

  modifier restricted() {
    // check if it is called by manager
    require(msg.sender == manager);
    // make sure players is not an empty list
    require(players.length > 0);

    _;
  }
}
```
And here are the tests I've run using Solhint:
```solidity
// test that the contract is not payable
test("test that the contract is not payable", () => {
  assert.equal(msg.value, 0);
});

// test that the contract is not callable
test("test that the contract is not callable", () => {
  assert.equal(msg.sender, address(0));
});

// test that the contract has a correct constructor
test("test that the contract has a correct constructor", () => {
  assert.equal(manager, msg.sender);
});

// test that the contract has a correct enter function
test("test that the contract has a correct enter function", () => {
  assert.equal(players.length, 1);
});

// test that the contract has a correct pickWinner function
test("test that the contract has a correct pickWinner function", () => {
  assert.equal(players[0], winner);
});

// test that the contract has a correct getCurrentBalance function
test("test that the contract has a correct getCurrentBalance function", () => {
  assert.equal(address(this).balance, 0);
});

// test that the contract has a correct getNumberOfPlayer function
test("test that the contract has a correct getNumberOfPlayer function", () => {
  assert.equal(players.length, 1);
});

// test that the contract has a correct getPlayers function
test("test that the contract has a correct getPlayers function", () => {
  assert.equal(players,
