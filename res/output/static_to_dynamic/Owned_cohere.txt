To improve the test coverage of your Solidity smart contract using dynamic analysis with Manticore, you can follow these steps and suggestions:

1. **Set up Manticore:**
   - Install Manticore CLI globally by following the instructions on their [official website](https://github.com/ChainSafe/mantis#installation).
   - Ensure that you have a supported version of Solidity installed. Manticore currently supports Solidity versions 0.4.25, 0.5.10, 0.6.10, and 0.7.4.

2. **Write Contract Unit Tests:**
   - Create a separate file for your contract unit tests, e.g., `Owned.tests.js`.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest for writing consistent and structured tests.

3. **Import Manticore and Solidity Compiler:**
   - In your project's `package.json` file, add dependencies for Manticore and the Solidity compiler. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "devDependencies": {
        "manticore": "^1.3.0",
        "solidity": "^0.8.0"
      }
    }
    ```

4. **Compile Contract and Deploy on Local Ethereum Network:**
   - Use a development framework like Truffle that integrates with the Solidity compiler and provides a local Ethereum network for deployment.
   - Compile your contract with the Solidity compiler and deploy it to the local network.

5. **Write Dynamic Analysis Tests with Manticore:**
   - Use the Manticore CLI to write and execute dynamic analysis tests for your contract. You can simulate different attack vectors and verify the contract's behavior and security assumptions.

6. **Implement Manticore Test Cases:**
   - Write test cases to cover different scenarios, including normal behavior, edge cases, and potential vulnerabilities. For example, you could test the `transferOwnership` method to ensure that only the current owner can call it.

   ```javascript
   // Owned.tests.js
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
   const { LedgerLive } = require("@ethersproject/ledger-live-provider");
   const { getContractFactory } = require("../deployUtils");
   
   const { expect } = require("@esm-bundle/chai");
   const { solidity } = require("ethereum-waffle");
   const { providers } = require("ethers");
   
   const { parseEther } = ethers.utils;
   const { getRandomBytes } = providers.echers;
   
   async function testTransferOwnership(owned, owner, newOwner) {
       await owned.transferOwnership(newOwner);
       const newOwnerBalance = await owned.balanceOf(newOwner);
       const ownerBalance = await owned.balanceOf(owner);
       expect(newOwnerBalance).to.eq(ownerBalance);
   }
   
   async function testOwnedConstructor(owned) {
       expect(owned.address).to.eq(await owned.owner());
   }
   
   async function testOnlyOwnerModifier(owned, owner) {
       const randomPerson = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address;
       await expect(owned.doSomething(randomPerson)).to.be.revertedWith("Only owner");
       await owned.doSomething(owner);
   }
   
   async function test Owned() {
       const owned = await getContractFactory("Owned").deploy();
       await testOwnedConstructor(owned);
       await testTransferOwnership(owned, ethers.constants.AddressZero, await ethers.provider.getAddress());
       await testOnlyOwnerModifier(owned, await ethers.provider.getAddress());
   }
   
   module.exports = {
       testOwned: testOwned
   };
```

7. **Run Tests:**
   - Use Jest to run your contract unit tests and Manticore to run your dynamic analysis tests.

By following these steps, you can enhance your smart contract testing coverage by incorporating both static checks with Solhint and dynamic analysis with Manticore. This combined approach ensures a more thorough validation of your contract's behavior and security. 

Remember to adapt these steps and examples to your specific project setup and requirements.
