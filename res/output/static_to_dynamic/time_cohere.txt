Sure, here is an example of dynamic smart contract tests using the Manticore tool:

```
// TimeTest.manticore

test "initial values" <| Time.constructor() => {
  start := fetch_big_uint(0, "start")
  marked := fetch_big_uint(0, "marked")
  return start == marked
}

test "mark function" <| Time.constructor(), mark() => {
  start := fetch_big_uint(0, "start")
  marked := fetch_big_uint(0, "marked")
  return marked > start
}

test "echidna_timepassed function" <| Time.constructor() => {
  start := fetch_big_uint(0, "start")
  marked := fetch_big_uint(0, "marked")
  return start != marked
}

test "echidna_moretimepassed function" <| Time.constructor() => {
  start := fetch_big_uint(0, "start")
  now := block_timestamp()
  return start + 10 weeks > now
}
```

This Manticore script defines four tests for the `Time` smart contract. 

The first test, "initial values", checks that the values of the `start` and `marked` variables are the same after the constructor has been executed. The second test, "mark function", checks that the `marked` variable has a greater value than the `start` variable after the constructor and the `mark` function have been executed. The third test, "echidna_timepassed function", checks that the `start` and `marked` variables have different values after the constructor has been executed, assuming that the `echidna_timepassed` function returns `true` if they are not equal. The fourth test, "echidna_moretimepassed function", checks that the current timestamp is more than 10 weeks in the past from the `start` variable after the constructor has been executed, assuming that the `echidna_moretimepassed` function returns `true` if this condition is met.

Note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the tests to suit your specific use case. 

Would you like me to assist you with anything else regarding smart contract testing?
