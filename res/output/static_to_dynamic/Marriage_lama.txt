Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your smart contract. Based on the code you provided and the results of the Solhint analysis, I can suggest some dynamic tests using Manticore.

First, let me summarize the issues found by Solhint:

1. The compiler version is not satisfied (^0.4.24 does not satisfy the ^0.8.0 semver requirement).
2. The state visibility is not explicitly marked.
3. The function visibility is not explicitly marked.
4. The rule is set with explicit type [var/s: uint].
5. The fallback function must be simple (no-complex-fallback).

Now, let me propose some dynamic tests using Manticore:

1. Test the contract's balance calculation:

Test that the balances of both the wife and husband are updated correctly when a withdrawal is made.

2. Test the contract's transfer function:

Test that the transfer function correctly transfers the specified amount to the specified address.

3. Test the contract's fallback function:

Test that the fallback function correctly transfers the specified amount to the specified address.

4. Test the contract's state visibility:

Test that the state visibility is correctly marked for the balances and the wife/husband addresses.

5. Test the contract's function visibility:

Test that the function visibility is correctly marked for the withdraw and transfer functions.

6. Test the contract's explicit type:

Test that the explicit type is correctly set for the balances and the wife/husband addresses.

These tests will help you ensure that your smart contract is working as intended and fix any issues found by Solhint.

Do you have any questions or would you like me to elaborate on any of the tests?
