Hello! As a helpful and concise assistant, I'd be happy to help you with your smart contract testing needs.

Based on the Solhint analysis you provided, I can see that there are a few issues with your smart contract. First, the compiler version must be declared. Second, the rule is set with explicit type [var/s: uint] for the variables x and _x. Third, the function name must be in mixedCase.

To test your smart contract, I would recommend using Manticore, which is a powerful tool for testing smart contracts. Manticore allows you to write dynamic tests for your smart contracts, which can help you catch bugs and edge cases that might not be caught by static analysis.

Here are some examples of how you can use Manticore to test your smart contract:

1. Test that the set function sets the value of x correctly:
```
test("set", async () => {
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(C.abi, C.address);
  const result = await contract.set(10);
  assert.equal(result, true);
  assert.equal(contract.x, 10);
});
```
2. Test that the echidna_large function returns true when x + 1 is not equal to 0:
```
test("echidna_large", async () => {
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(C.abi, C.address);
  const result = await contract.echidna_large();
  assert.equal(result, true);
});
```
3. Test that the echidna_large function returns false when x + 1 is equal to 0:
```
test("echidna_large_zero", async () => {
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(C.abi, C.address);
  contract.x = 0;
  const result = await contract.echidna_large();
  assert.equal(result, false);
});
```
These are just a few examples of how you can use Manticore to test your smart contract. You can write more tests to cover other functions and scenarios as well.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
