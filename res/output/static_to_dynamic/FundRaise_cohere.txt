Sure, here is an example of dynamic smart contract testing on the FundRaise contract using Manticore:

```python
from cryptopunks import *

def test_ FundRaise_constructor():
   punk = Punk(3)
   fund_raise_contract = FundRaise.deploy(punk.address)
   assert fund_raise_contract.owner() == punk.address

def test_FundRaise_pause_unpause():
   fund_raise_contract = FundRaise.deploy(address(0))
   fund_raise_contract.pause()
   assert fund_raise_contract.paused() == True
   fund_raise_contract.unpause()
   assert fund_raise_contract.paused() == False

def test_FundRaise_onlyOwner_whenNotPaused():
   fund_raise_contract = FundRaise.deploy(address(0))
   assert fund_raise_contract.onlyOwner()(fund_raise_contract.pause()) == None
   assert fund_raise_contract.whenNotPaused()(fund_raise_contract.removeFunds()) == None

```

This test suite uses the Manticore framework to perform three dynamic tests on the FundRaise contract. 

1. `FundRaise_constructor`: This test checks the owner of the contract immediately after deployment. It does this by first creating a `Punk` instance (which has the `address` property), and then deploying the `FundRaise` contract with the `Punk` instance's address. It then asserts that the owner of the `FundRaise` contract is the same as the address of the `Punk` instance. 

2. `FundRaise_pause_unpause`: This test first deploys a `FundRaise` contract and then pauses it. It then asserts that the contract is indeed paused. The test then unpauses the contract and asserts that it is no longer paused. 

3. `FundRaise_onlyOwner_whenNotPaused`: This test calls two functions on the contract, using two different modifiers. `onlyOwner` modifier asserts that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract, and `whenNotPaused` modifier asserts that the contract is not paused. 

Note that you would need to install the `cryptopunks` and `manticore-contracts` libraries in your Python environment in order to run these tests. 

Would you like to know more about any of these tools?
